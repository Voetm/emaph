abstract = {We present a dataset of a single (N = 1) participant diagnosed with major depressive disorder, who com-pleted 1478 measurements over the course of 239 consecutive days in 2012 and 2013. The experiment included a double-blind phase in which the dosage of anti-depressant medication was gradually reduced. The entire study looked at momentary affective states in daily life before, during, and after the double-blind phase. The items, which were asked ten times a day, cover topics like mood, physical condition and social contacts. Also, depressive symptoms were measured on a weekly basis using the Symptom Check-list Revised (SCL-90-R). The data are suitable for various time-series analyses and studies in complex dynamical systems. Funding statement: This study was supported by an Aspasia grant (MW., NWO grant), and by the Brain Foundation of the Netherlands (MW., grant No. F2012(1)-03).
